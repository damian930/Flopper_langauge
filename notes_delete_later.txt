How to create functions
 -- Functiona need to have variable to store. 
        Arg list specifies the types. 
        I need to store the var names and types.
 -- Need a function name
 -- Need a body, the body i can just store as a scope. 
        Bu then when exedcuting a will be adding the variables set 
        by user to the scope manually. 
 -- I will then need to have a statemnet for func creating, 
        and also an expession for a func call, so they have different executions.
